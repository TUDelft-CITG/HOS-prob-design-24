# Visual Studio Code (VSC)

_Note: you are not required to use VS Code for your CIE42X0-PD assignments. However, it is extremely useful, and trust me---if you ever plan on doing anything related to programming again in your life after this quarter (for example, a thesis...), it is worth the effort to learn this tool._ 

Visual Studio Code (VSC) is and _Integrated Development Environment_ (IDE): a software that helps users program more effectively, as it combines different workflows in one place. For our purpose VS Code is very useful because allows us to:
- manage files and sub-directories within our working directory
- execute Python code (and any other programming language!), including Jupyter notebooks
- manage Python environments
- use Git and version control
- many other things!

Although Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook are also IDE's, they don't provide as many features as VS Code. The availability of extensions, in particular, is exceptional. 

_The remainder of this page covers installation and use of VS Code. Please contact Robert directly if you have any questions or suggestion for improvement, as this is the first time using these instructions with students._
