# Workshop 02

This workshop will apply extreme value analysis to a real wave dataset from the North Sea. It is partly a review of MUDE material, but you will be asked to use the new material from your lecture on Tuesday to validate the threshold of the GPD distribution that you choose. Most of the code is written for you, but you will need to implement one or more of the validation methods.

Instructions (part 1) - the logistics:
- make sure you and your group members have a GitHub account
- using the link provided, create/join a group on GitHub
- make sure you send Robert and email informing him of your group members and GitHub usernames (include the info provided [here](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/info/#assignments)!)


Instructions (Part 2) - the analysis:
- work through the notebook, completing all tasks (answering questions with text in the notebook is optional).
- write answers to the questions in the file `Report.md`
- commit your files back to the repository

**Due date:** make your last commit before 4am on Tuesday, May 7, 2024.
