We decided to start this unit off with good news: **the in-class session on Friday during Week 1 is cancelled!** With the holiday on Thursday, we thought many of you might enjoy the chance to sleep in. It should disappear from your course calendar within a day or two.

However, there is still plenty of fun for you to have with this unit during Week 1: we have prepared a few short videos to introduce the material and a quick refresher of our first main topic, Extreme Value Analysis. There is also some reading and two homework assignments you can start, which are listed in the Calendar page under Week 1 (both assignments can be done over the first 3 weeks of Q4). Please read through the "Unit Information" page on this website to get an overview for how the unit will work, and what our expectations are. If you have any questions, please send Robert an email. Depending on how many questions come in, I may set up a FAQ page on the website.

To help you get through the material in Week 1, our teaching assistant Benjamin is available during the cancelled class time on Friday morning; if you would like to ask him a few questions, please contact him directly to let him know.

This unit is focused on providing you useful probabilistic tools for designing the structures and systems that are covered in the design units that are part of this B Module, which is why the course is set up with workshop-style sessions on Friday to apply and practice the material you are expected to read and study during the week. In total there are only 5 Friday sessions, due to the holidays in week 1 (sort of), 2 and 4.

That's it for now---we are looking forward to seeing you in class...in Week 3!
