title: "Week 2: Extreme Value Analysis"
---

_More info coming soon! For now, review the current announcement for Week 3._

There are no in-class sessions this week! However, there is definitely work to be done. Specifically:
- Check out the new [Software page](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/HOS-prob-design-24/software/) of the website and try setting up VS Code and a Python virtual environment.
- Do [Workshop 03](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/2024/workshop/03.html){:target="_blank"}. Note that it is a notebook, and as long as you can successfully run the cells, you will be prepared for Week 4.
