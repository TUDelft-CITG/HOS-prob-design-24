title: "Week 5: Component Reliability (continued)"
---

Lecture
: Recap of WS04. Interpretation of component reliability analysis, and presentation of results.

Workshop
: WS05 will apply component reliability techniques to an existing deterministic problem and report the results. **This workshop is turned in for feedback/grading** (should be possible to finish in class on Friday, but you have until Tuesday, May 28 at 4:00 AM to submit it; you can choose your own groups).

<!-- Holidays
: None -->

The main goals for this week are:<br>
<i>1. Identify the key results of a FORM analysis and be able to interpret them.</i><br>
<i>2. Explain the differences, advantages and disadvantages between MCS and FORM.</i><br>
<i>3. Clearly report the setup, analysis and results of a component reliability analysis.</i><br>

Additional material will be provided in the component reliability section of the [Workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/intro.html){:target="_blank"}.
{: .content }

Review WS04 and be sure you understand how the OpenTURNs code sets up and executes the MCS and FORM algorithms, as we will rely on this in WS05; the solution (`Report.md` and `Analysis_solution.ipynb`) has been posted to your GitHub repositories (update your fork) and the [Workbook](https://teachbooks.github.io/HOS-workbook/intro.html){:target="_blank"}.<br>
